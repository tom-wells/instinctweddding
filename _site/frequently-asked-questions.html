            <h2>Q.</h2>
            <h3>Who will capture my wedding?</h3>
            <h2>A.</h2>
            <p> Whether you book photography or video package, you will always have Justina or Lloyd
                with you and in most cases another one or two of our team members working with them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Q.</h2>
            <h3>Will we meet before my wedding?</h3>
            <h2>A.</h2>
            <p> We love to meet our couples before the big day, either in real life or via video chat. More
                and more couples choose to have engagement, or pre-wedding sessions and its a great
                opportunity for us to meet and get to know each other before the big day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Q.</h2>
            <h3>I’m shy in front of the camera, will I have to pose a lot?</h3>
            <h2>A.</h2>
            <p> We love capturing the real moments and emotions as they happen. For majority of the
                day we love to stay invisible and capture your day as it is, just from the most beautiful
                angle so you wouldn’t even notice us there. During the photo hour, we will give your gentle
                guidance, making sure you feel relaxed and look your best, but we never ask you to do
                awkward and unnatural cliche poses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Q.</h2>
            <h3>Do you offer wedding albums?</h3>
            <h2>A.</h2>
            <p>Yes. You can order your wedding album once you receive your photo gallery. The
                process is easy and quick and we will be happy to guide you along the way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">

            <h3>Who do I contact if I have any questions or concerns before my wedding?</h3>
            <h2>A.</h2>

                is perfectly captured. You can always email, text or call her and she always get back to you
