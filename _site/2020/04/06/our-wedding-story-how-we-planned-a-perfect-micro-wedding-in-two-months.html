          <h2> Our wedding story: how we planned a perfect micro wedding in two months  </h2>
          <p>Just like every bride out there, I think that our wedding was the most exciting, amazing, memorable and fun and that’s why I would love to share our wedding day story!</p>

<p>First, Lloyd and I were engaged for about 7 months (that’s a story for another day), and sometimes we would sit and think, what sort of wedding we would like… sometime in a couple of years, maybe. But never really settling with any plan, or even a date.</p>

<p>And then, one sunny May day, a couple of days after my birthday, we found out I was pregnant with our first baby. I knew, it’s a norm to wait a few weeks to tell people, but I told one of my best friends straight away. She started screaming, singing and looked like the most excited person in the universe for about 45 minutes whilst we were driving by the sea. As we got to the sea, she asked if we still planned to get married. oh, yeah, I said. It would be cool to get married before the baby is born. So I took my phone out and texted Lloyd ‘Hey, do you wanna get married this summer?’ he replied ‘yeah, okay’.</p>

<p><img src="/images/uploads/img_8333_websize.jpg" alt="Lloyd and Justina on the Seven Sister Cliffs in East Sussex after their wedding ceremony" title="Bride and Groom on the Seven Sisters Cliffs " /></p>

<p>And this is how we decided to get married. As you can imagine, when you’re a wedding photographer, your schedule is pretty intense in the summer but we had one weekend free in July. So it was decided - it was going to be that free weekend in July.</p>

<p>We started dreaming of locations. It took about 3 minutes to decide on Seven Sisters Cliffs in East Sussex. This is a place, that we love, it’s stunning, it’s not too far. and it’s free. As you can imagine, when you decide to get married in a couple of months, the budget can be a bit tricky. we had zero savings for the wedding. we had zero savings in general, for that matter (this was still the time, when we would happily spend all our income on gigs, trips, air b’n’b’s, good food and going out.)</p>

<p>Shortly after, we shared the plans to get married with Lloyd’s family (together with the announcement, that they will be first time grandparents too). I just loved the enthusiasm and they offered to have the party in their back garden.</p>

<p>Guest list was a tricky one but we knew we wanted to keep it to the absolute minimum and only invite people that we absolutely loved, were close to, who were actively involved in our lives, and we knew would carry on being involved. This was really important for both of us to feel completely, freely, weirdly ourselves.</p>

<p>The total was 17 people including children. Perfect number!</p>

<p>The planning was super easy. We booked a registry office ceremony for two days before our wedding day. Normally, the waiting list is quite long, but as I was pregnant, and they just had a cancellation, we got super lucky to get a day two days before ‘the real wedding’.</p>

<p>So grateful that Lloyd’s parent’s let us have the reception in their back garden and they were full of ideas and inspiration. At this point, the first semester of pregnancy was kicking hard. Even though, I always was in a good spirits, I preferred to be in good spirits on the sofa, and going to sleep between 6.30 and 7.30pm, after watching about 10-15 minutes of Netflix before my eyes would be too heavy. Lloyd’s mum created a Pinterest board. I loved every idea she had for this low key, bohemian micro wedding. Lloyd’s sister’s boyfriends mum, who we have never even met, offered to do a vegan wedding cake. I ordered a dress online. It was way too small, so I ordered another one. And that was it. The planning was done.</p>

<p><img src="/images/uploads/img_8684-2_websize.jpg" alt="Home made vegan cake with summer fruits " title="vegan wedding cake " /></p>

<p>The day itself was special. Although, in the morning, I woke up angry af. Third month of being pregnant, hit the emotions hard. I decided (on the morning), that I don’t <em>actually</em> want to get married. My friends asked me to reconsider. So I reconsidered and decided to I <em>actually do want</em> to get married. Thankfully that was the only hiccup of the day.</p>

<p>I didn’t have bridesmaids, but I had my friends with me, who did my hair, make up, helped me decide on the bracelet. They even tied a tiny picture of my mum who passed away on a sunflower (a.k.a. my wedding bouquet).</p>

<p>Then we all drove to the Seven Sisters Cliffs. Lloyd and our wedding party were waiting on the hill, while my brother and my little nephew walked me up the hill (with a couple of stops to catch the breath, of course).</p>

<p>The ceremony was perfect. We took our time, paced it the way we felt was right. We exchanged our vows and I think it was my favourite part of the day. When Lloyd was reading his vows to me, promising things that felt real and heartfelt. I love, that both of us, made vows not only to each other, but also to our daughter in my tummy. We made vows to encourage each other, to be there for each other. And absolutely nothing we weren’t sure we could keep. It was a declaration. Stating the obvious, but with witnesses. With our closest and dearest.</p>

<p>After hanging out in this spectacular location, we had a few photos, went to dip our feet in the sea, and headed to our parents-in-law garden for the wedding reception.</p>

<p>The wedding reception at Lloyd’s parents garden was amazing. They did an incredible job to turn the garden into a place that looked ‘just like from Pinterest’ as one of my friends noted.</p>

<p>We were all sitting outside on the grass, sipping non alcoholic beer, eating burgers that Lloyd’s dad cooked on the BBQ, talking, laughing and it felt good. It felt so good, so real, so us. I felt so connected with all the people there. And it felt so special knowing, that this is how our first hours of being married are going, that our daughter was also there, even though still inside my body, celebrating with us. It was so nice to have the most awkward first dance, to see beautiful golden hour. And be done by 7pm. Which, in fact, was already past my three months pregnant bed time.</p>

<p>And you know what is the best part? Is that our lives as a married couple, are still very much like our wedding day. We do what we love. With the people we love. We only promise what we can keep. And we create our own rules to create the life we feel proud living.</p>
