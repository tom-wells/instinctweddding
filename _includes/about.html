                  <h2>Hello</h2>

                  <p>We are a team of Kent and London based wedding photographers and videographers,
                    working together to create beautiful, honest and timeless wedding photos and videos for
                    couples.
                </p>

                <p>Instinct Wedding was founded in 2017 by Justina and Lloyd, a husband and wife, who are
                    the main shooters and visionnaires in the company. Whether you book photography, video
                    or joint package, you will always have one of us on the day.
                </p>
                
                <p>We both have background in Fine Art, and having worked and experimented with many art
                    mediums and techniques, we fell in love with photography and video and the ability to
                    capture memories for generations to remember.
                </p>

                <p>On the wedding day, whether we are doing photography, video or both, we try and stay
                    discreet, positive, helpful and most importantly concentrating on capturing all the beautiful
                    moments, emotions, events as they unfold.
                </p>

                <p>We are based in Kent and are happy to cover your beautiful wedding anywhere in UK or
                    Europe - get in touch!
                </p>
                    
                    <p></p>When we are not working, we love spending time with our family (we have two beautiful
                    daughters), travelling, going for long walks in nature, road tripping and discovering
                    heritage villages.</p>
