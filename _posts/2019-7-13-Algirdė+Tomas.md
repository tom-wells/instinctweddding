Algirdė and Tomas wedding was a living proof that you don't need to stay in one venue all day but instead you can go on a day long adventure with all your guests in a mini bus instead.

 

With twenty people, the most darling to their hearts, the couple have decided to rent a mini bus and after having their ceremony in the registry house, went to enjoy some beautiful Lithuanian countryside as newly weds. 

 

Early summer nature had beaten any studio background and everyone enjoyed nice walk in beautiful natural spots.

 

In the evening, we all went to a lovely villa for wedding dinner, toasts and celebration. One of the most beautiful thing was when we ventured out by the lake in the golden hour, just when the sun started to set and Algirdė and Tomas had their first dance on a bridge, with no music, just them two dancing to the birdsong.

Here, have a look yourself
