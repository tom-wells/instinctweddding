I got super excited when Nicollette suggested to have her and Mikey's engagement session in St Dunstan-in-the-East in London. To be honest, I have never heard of this place before but after a quick Google search, I became convinced this was going to be a great spot and an amazing backdrop for some beautiful engagement shots.

Hidden just a few minutes walk away from the ever busy London Bridge, there is this little place of quiet and tranquility. What used to be a Church of England parish church, that got destroyed in the World War II, has now been turned into a public garden with beautiful plants growing freely on the few left standing walls of this old building.

After arriving to the park and seeing Nicollette and Mikey waiting in the garden, I got even more excited as the couple looked absolutely beautiful and their outfit choice was absolutely spot on for this location.


Even though, it was a cloudy late Spring evening, Nicollette and Mikey's smiles and love for each other has really made this session special and beautiful. And we absolutely can't wait till we get to capture this beautiful couple's wedding next year!
