1. **Smoother and easier booking & communication process**  

When booking photography and video team, you will save yourself that extra contract to sign, extra deposit to pay, extra time explaining your vision to two teams. When you book one team, you will have one dedicated person, responsible for managing all shooters in the team. There will be one person responsible that your wedding is captured in the most beautiful way ever and you can always reach to and chat to that person.
