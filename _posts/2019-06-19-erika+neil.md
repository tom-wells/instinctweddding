title: Erika & Neil Engagement Session in the moody Camber Sands and Rye
---

Some days are just good days.

One of days Good Days was a day when I got a pleasure to meet Erika and Neil for their engagement session in Rye. At first we met at a little cafe, called Simon the Pieman and had a chat about their wedding plans (which, by the way, I absolutely love and cannot wait for their wedding by the Scottish loch later this year!)

After a little chat we ventured for a little walk in the beautiful ancient streets of Rye. As it was a nice Sunday afternoon, the streets were quite busy, we decided to drive to the Camber Sands - a beautiful sandy beach just about 10 minutes away from Rye.

The minute we got out of the car and stepped on the sand, I could see the change in Erika and Neil as they literally lit up and got so excited and playful. You could definitely see that sea, salty air, sand, moody evening sky was completely their element. 

From then on I didn't even need any of my posing 'prompts', everything went so naturally, and oh so beautifully...

Just look at this couple <3
